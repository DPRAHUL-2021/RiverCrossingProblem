# River Crossing Puzzle Solver

This C++ project solves the classic river crossing puzzle using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The puzzle involves transporting a man, a tiger, a goat, and a cabbage across a river without leaving the tiger alone with the goat or the goat alone with the cabbage. The solution finds the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state while respecting these constraints.

## Features

- Solves the river crossing puzzle using BFS.
- Ensures constraints are met at each step.
- Finds the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.

## Usage

Compile and run the program to see the solution for the puzzle.
